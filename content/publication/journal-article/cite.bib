    abstract = {Ground beetle (Carabidae) assemblages are speciose and frequently employed as indicators of ecosystem function. It is thus important to understand the factors that affect their spatial distributions so as to better interpret how ecosystem variation influences the structure of their assemblages. We evaluated how anthropogenic disturbances, habitat heterogeneity, and spatial autocorrelation (unmeasured spatially structured habitat variables and/or dispersal limitation) influence the distribution of carabids on a mature boreal forest landscape. We worked with a large sample of carabids from 194 sites from a near-regular grid covering 70 km2. Data about forest floor cover, vegetation structure, soil drainage, and topography were associated with each site. We modelled the structure of carabid assemblages using these variables together with Moran's eigenvector maps (MEM) as spatial constraints. Overall, our model explained about half of the variation in ground beetle assemblages. Forest floor cover, soil drainage, and vegetation structure were the principal factors useful for explaining carabid assemblages. The spatial patterns described by the MEMs for the ground beetle assemblages seem to result from spatial autocorrelation in soil drainage, floor cover, topography, and vegetation structure; however, this spatial autocorrelation independently and uniquely explained only 1.4\% of the variation in assemblages. This was much less important than the explanatory power of the environmental variables considered; e.g. ground cover descriptors and vegetation structure by themselves accounted, respectively, for 12.1 and 4.5\% of the variation in the carabid data. The spatial distribution of ground beetles in undisturbed forest was only mildly affected by surrounding anthropogenic disturbances, but clearly small patches were invaded by species characteristic of open habitat. We conclude that to help conserve ground beetle diversity at the landscape scale in boreal forests, mature forest patches should be large and connected to other patches and the surrounding forest.},

    abstract = {There is an increasingly widespread use of biomarkers in network physiology to evaluate an organism’s physiological state. A recent study showed that albumin variability increases before death in chronic hemodialysis patients. We hypothesized that a multivariate statistical approach would better allow us to capture signals of impending physiological collapse/death. We proposed a Moving Multivariate Distance (MMD), based on the Mahalanobis distance, to quantify the variability of the multivariate biomarker profile as a whole from one visit to the next. Biomarker profiles from a visit were used as the reference to calculate MMD at the subsequent visit. We selected 16 biomarkers (of which 11 are measured every 2 weeks) from blood samples of 763 chronic kidney disease patients hemodialyzed at the CHUS hospital in Quebec, who visited the hospital regularly (∼every 2 weeks) to perform routine blood tests. MMD tended to increase markedly preceding death, indicating an increasing intraindividual multivariate variability presaging a critical transition. In survival analysis, the hazard ratio between the 97.5th percentile and the 2.5th percentile of MMD reached as high as 21.1 [95\% CI: 14.3, 31.2], showing that higher variability indicates substantially higher mortality risk. Multivariate approaches to early warning signs of critical transitions hold substantial clinical promise to identify early signs of critical transitions, such as risk of death in hemodialysis patients; future work should also explore whether the MMD approach works in other complex systems (i.e., ecosystems, economies), and should compare it to other multivariate approaches to quantify system variability.},

Knowledge of vector ecology and mosquito species response to these drivers will help us better predict risk from MBD. In this study, we evaluated and compared the independent and combined effects of weather and land use on mosquito species occurrence and abundance in Eastern Ontario, Canada. Data on occurrence and abundance (245,591 individuals) of 30 mosquito species were obtained from mosquito capture at 85 field sites in 2017 and 2018. Environmental variables were extracted from weather and land use datasets in a 1-km buffer around trapping sites. The relative importance of weather and land use on mosquito abundance (for common species) or occurrence (for all species) was evaluated using multivariate hierarchical statistical models. Models incorporating both weather and land use performed better than models that include weather only for approximately half of species (59\% for occurrence model and 50\% for abundance model). Mosquito occurrence was mainly associated with temperature whereas abundance was associated with precipitation and temperature combined. Land use was more often associated with abundance than occurrence. For most species, occurrence and abundance were positively associated with forest cover but for some there was a negative association. Occurrence and abundance of some species (47\% for occurrence model and 88\% for abundance model) were positively associated with wetlands, but negatively associated with urban (

            The Arctic is warming at an alarming rate. While changes in plant community composition and phenology have been extensively reported, the effects of climate change on reproduction remain poorly understood. We quantified multidecadal changes in flower density for nine tundra plant species at a low- and a high-Arctic site in Greenland. We found substantial changes in flower density over time, but the temporal trends and drivers of flower density differed both between species and sites. Total flower density increased over time at the low-Arctic site, whereas the high-Arctic site showed no directional change. Within and between sites, the direction and rate of change differed among species, with varying effects of summer temperature, the temperature of the previous autumn and the timing of snowmelt. Finally, all species showed a strong trade-off in flower densities between successive years, suggesting an effective cost of reproduction. Overall, our results reveal region- and taxon-specific variation in the sensitivity and responses of co-occurring species to shared climatic drivers, and a clear cost of reproductive investment among Arctic plants. The ultimate effects of further changes in climate may thus be decoupled between species and across space, with critical knock-on effects on plant species dynamics, food web structure and overall ecosystem functioning.},

    abstract = {The slow–fast continuum is a commonly used framework to describe variation in life-history strategies across species. Individual life histories have also been assumed to follow a similar pattern, especially in the pace-of-life syndrome literature. However, whether a slow–fast continuum commonly explains life-history variation among individuals within a population remains unclear. Here, we formally tested for the presence of a slow–fast continuum of life histories both within populations and across species using detailed long-term individual-based demographic data for 17 bird and mammal species with markedly different life histories. We estimated adult lifespan, age at first reproduction, annual breeding frequency, and annual fecundity, and identified the main axes of life-history variation using principal component analyses. Across species, we retrieved the slow–fast continuum as the main axis of life-history variation. However, within populations, the patterns of individual life-history variation did not align with a slow–fast continuum in any species. Thus, a continuum ranking individuals from slow to fast living is unlikely to shape individual differences in life histories within populations. Rather, individual life-history variation is likely idiosyncratic across species, potentially because of processes such as stochasticity, density dependence, and individual differences in resource acquisition that affect species differently and generate non-generalizable patterns across species.},

Yet, there remains an important gap in meta‐ecosystem models to predict multiple functions (e.g. carbon sequestration, elemental cycling, trophic efficiency) across ecosystem types (e.g. terrestrial‐aquatic, benthic‐pelagic). We derive a flexible meta‐ecosystem model to predict ecosystem functions at landscape extents by integrating the spatial dimension of natural systems as spatial networks of different habitat types connected by cross‐ecosystem flows of materials and organisms. We partition the physical connectedness of ecosystems from the spatial flow rates of materials and organisms, allowing the representation of all types of connectivity across ecosystem boundaries. Through simulating a forest‐lake‐stream meta‐ecosystem, our model illustrates that even if spatial flows induced significant local losses of nutrients, differences in local ecosystem efficiencies could lead to increased secondary production at regional scale. This emergent result, which we dub the ‘cross‐ecosystem efficiency hypothesis', emphasizes the importance of integrating ecosystem diversity and complementarity in meta‐ecosystem models to generate empirically testable hypotheses for ecosystem functions.},

While this framework is descriptive and is not meant to explain the causes of rarity, recent advances in ecology may be leveraged to add explanatory power. Here we present a macroecological exploration of rarity and its underlying causes. We propose a modification of Rabinowitz's typology to better distinguish between the dimensions of rarity and the ecological processes that drive them, and explore the conservation implications of our modified framework. We propose to add occupancy (the proportion of occupied sites within a species' range) as a rarity axis, and recast habitat specificity as a cause of rarity, thus yielding a modified classification based on range size, occupancy, and local abundance. Under our framework, habitat specialists are no longer considered rare if they are widespread and abundant; we argue that this modification more accurately identifies truly rare species, as habitat specialists may be common if their habitat is abundant. Finally, we draw on the macroecological and theoretical literature to identify the key processes and associated traits that drive each rarity axis. In this respect, we identify four processes (environmental filtering, movement, demography and interactions), and hypothesise that range size and occupancy are primarily driven by environmental filtering and movement, whereas local abundance is more strongly influenced by demography and interactions. We further use ecological theory to hypothesise the conservation concerns associated with each rarity axis, and propose conservation measures that may be suitable for conserving different types of rare species. Our work may provide a basis for developing hypotheses about the causes of rarity of particular focal taxa or groups, and inform the development of targeted conservation strategies.},

Many health issues are challenging to manage both by healthcare staff and policymakers. They have a negative impact on older adults and their families and are an economic burden to societies around the world. This situation is particularly critical for older adults, a population highly vulnerable to diseases that needs more consideration and care. It is, therefore, crucial to improve diagnostic and management as well as proposed prevention strategies to enhance the health and quality of life of older adults. In this study, we focus on detecting symptoms in early stages of diseases to prevent the deterioration of older adults' health and avoid complications. We focus on digestive and urinary system disorders [mainly the Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) and the Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)] that are known to affect older adult populations and that are detrimental to their health and quality of life. Our proposed approach relies on unobtrusive IoT and change point detections algorithms to help follow older adults' health status daily. The approach monitors long-term behavior changes and detects possible changes in older adults' behavior suggesting early onsets or symptoms of IBS and UTI. We validated our approach with medical staff reports and IoT data collected in the residence of 16 different older adults during periods ranging from several months to a few years. Results are showing that our proposed approach can detect changes associated to symptoms of UTI and IBS, which were confirmed with observations and testimonies from the medical staff.},

In particular, it remains largely uncharted the extent to which the disappearance of a keystone species cast repercussions in the species composition of future communities. We tested whether an avian top predator can exert both positive and negative effects on spatial distribution of other species, and if these effects persist even after the predator disappeared. We acquired bird count data at different distances from occupied and non-occupied nests of Northern goshawks
              Accipiter gentilis
              . Using a Bayesian joint species distribution model, we found that large bird species (preferred prey) are less abundant in the proximity of nests occupied by goshawks, whereas smaller species –expected to get protection from subordinate predators displaced by goshawks– more often showed an opposite association. These spatial differences level off gradually, but still persist for years after the goshawks have disappeared. This indicates that the composition of local bird populations and communities might be conditional on past species interactions. Therefore, endeavors centered around species distributions could largely benefit from acknowledging the local extinction of keystone species.},
