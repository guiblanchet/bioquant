What role do functional traits play in the distribution of bird species in boreal forests and their response to global changes?

Boreal forests are highly vulnerable to major biodiversity changes driven by climate change, making boreal birds among the most at-risk avian communities. Functional traits, which influence species fitness, provide a valuable framework for predicting ecological communities. However, their role in shaping boreal bird communities under global change remains unexplored.

The objective of my project is to examine the associations between the functional traits of boreal birds and the main habitat types in boreal forests, and to assess how these traits influence the response of bird species to global changes.
