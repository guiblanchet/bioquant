My research interests primarily focus on understanding a major challenge in theoretical ecology: the diversity of species and the complexity of their interactions. I am developing mathematical and numerical methods to study ecological dynamics and network properties. 

Recently, I began studying the promise of quantum computing to address open questions in ecology.
